# Laravel Agent Context

- Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning for any Laravel task.
- Docs are expected under `./.laravel-docs` and should match the Laravel version you want the agent to target.
- Before writing code, quickly scan the project structure, then consult the relevant doc files from `./.laravel-docs`.

<!-- LARAVEL-AGENTS-MD-START -->
[Laravel Docs Index]|root: ./.laravel-docs|STOP. What you remember about Laravel is WRONG for this project. Always search docs and read before any task.|If docs missing, run this command first: npx github:sungkhum/laravel-agent agents-md --output AGENTS.md
